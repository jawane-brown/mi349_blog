            <h3>Maintance Tips when Modifying Your 2016+ Cadillac ATS 2.0T</h3>
            <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="https://instagram.com/jawane-brown">Jawane Brown</a></address>
            <time datetime="2023-06-01" title="June 1, 2023">Jun 1, 2023</time> 
            <p>The Cadillac ATS 2.0T is one of General Motors' luxury compact sedans. It offers a combination of stylish design cues, impressive performance, and advanced technology. The exterior design is sleek and modern, showcasing clean lines, sharp lights, and a bold grille that embodies Cadillac's distinctive styling.</p>
            <p><img alt="Picture of blacked out Cadillac ATS. The coupe is being shown." src="images/ats.png" /></p>
            <p>I've owned a 2017 Cadillac ATS 2.0t for the past two years now, and after modifying it and learning the car on the daily basis, I can provide some insights into maintenance for this vehicle.  Starting with the basics, if you do not have a manual with your vehicle, you can find it online. The manual has the maintenacne schedule, showing owners the recommended intervals by mileage for certain components of the vehicle. These are extremely useful, but as owners experience the car more, we begin to find preventative maintenace tasks. When I first modified my vehicle, I did little to no research on the vehicle, which was my first fail. I installed a cold air intake, catted downpipe, ECU tune, and transmission tune. With that, I quickly fell in love with everything about the vehicle, for all of 2 months. I was in the middle of my hour drive from home to school when my vehicle lost all power, smoking from the tailpipe and under the hood. After researching at this point, I found out that Cadillac's piston rings in the LTG engine are extremely weak, even from factory. Adding power and increasing airflow resulted in the piston rings melting, allowing oil to fill up my third cylinder, finally cracking the long block. What did I do next? Bought a new engine and tried again. If you plan to modify your LTG product, (ATS, CTS, Camaro), this is what you NEED to do before. First, make sure regular maintenance is up to date. Next, purchase a high performing oil catch can system. With the vehicle bieng turbocharged and having 20 pounds of boost from factory, oil flows within the air and into the intake manifold, called blowby. Furthermore, consider purchasing and installing forged internals, such as pistons. There are forged pistons on the market that can handle over 1000hp. With these products, you will be able to install Stage 1 modifications and enjoy the sound of a turbo whistle and exhilirating acceleration throughout the entire rev range. Turbo boost will be at your disposal. </p>
